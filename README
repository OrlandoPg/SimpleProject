The OrlangoPg Simple project is an open source project that will allow its memebers to participate in a project
that allows them to practice use PostgreSQL as a ORDBMS back end to a web project.  As its name implies it will
be a "Simple Project" aimed at beginners to Postgresql.  We will focus on things like basic CRUD, Stored Procedures,
and schema design, gradually moving up into advanced features like table-space management, hardware, version control, 
etc...
